This is an implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger with base code provide by Udacity.  
Open the index.html file in a web browser to display the game UI. 
Use arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player to avoid the bugs. If the player is hit by a bug the player's position will be reset to the initial position when the game started.
